LUYA Admin module release 1.2 and cms 1.0.4

## Admin Security

Regarding a security audit from a swiss based security company we have made a few improvments only for security:

+ Unparsable Json Cruft: all json responses are now prepend with an unparsable cruft `[]|};` in order to prevent "json hijacking" (https://portswigger.net/blog/json-hijacking-for-the-modern-web).
+ The angular source code is now uglified and minified. Therefore angular strict di is now enabled by default.
+ If a user change the email in the admin, we have now an option which sends a token to the old email adress which has to be ented to change the current adress.
+ The admin login security token has now an expiration time and can be configured.
+ Login attempts are now tracked by the session (session based attemption limit) and if the user email is correct another limitation for user identifed login is available. After 5 attempts a lockout for 1 hour is enabled by default.
+ Max idle time of admin users can now be configured.

## Admin general improvments

+ NgRest attributes can now display based on conditions, assuming you have a select with categories, it allows you to display field only when a category is select (https://github.com/luyadev/luya-module-admin/blob/master/src/ngrest/base/Plugin.php#L53-L71)
+ Filemanager provides option to switch between inline or download for file delivery, and renaming of files is possible to. We also have mode some improvments on file details as well as display full screen preview.
+ Storage system is now full swapable. Using amazon S3 is now possible and available: https://github.com/luyadev/luya-aws
+ Admin storage system speeed. We have significant reduced the speed in order to load all admin files and images.
+ Improved general PHP docs and removed deperecated methods see upgrade.md
+ Robot fonts now supports (+Extended), Cyrillic (+Extended), Greek (+Extended), Vietnamese.

You can download and install LUYA admin version 1.2 (`~1.2.0` in composer). Make sure to run the `migrate` command afterwards as it contains new database migrations. See the full [changelog] und [upgrade] document.

##Â CMS

Along with admin we have also released cms version 1.0.4

+ Minification and uglification of angular code
+ New command to cleanup the cms, removing deleted pages, blocks and log files: `cms/page/cleanup`.
+ New property to provide paths to blocks in order to import them `luya\cms\frontend\Module::$blocks`.
+ New command to list blocks and to migrate them from console `cms/block/find` and `cms/block/migrate`. The migrate command is intresting when you are deleting an old block, but maybe want to migrate all the existing content which is bound to the block with a new one.
