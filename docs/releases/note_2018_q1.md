# Q1 2018 overview

---

3 Months ago we released LUYA version 1.0, positive feedback from developers around the globe, lot of issues about improvments or bugs.

---

We also started the journy towards headless system as we think this makes LUYA a very unique system among the others, we don't want to make "just another" content system. We believe the future of applications will be a bunch of differnt systems and components bound together and not just one system which does everything, even for scalling the application server side. The cms api's and client library needs a lot of work but it will allow you to make a website without to install any depecies, all trough LUYA headless client (menu, content, properties, layouts) enable caching trough PSR6 (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) will make the output blazing fast! So you don't have to deal with the application itself or the environment. Of course colllecting data from all the built in admin APIs is available too, or your own admin modules, but the headless cms system with STRUCTURED block data will make LUYA a TRUE UNIQUE HEADLESS CMS AND ADMIN experience.

Therefore we have made a new API Users endpoint which provides informations about API access. So you can test your endpoints and see what permissions are available.

So in order to see what the an API users (ar any other admin user of course) have done we have also built a more detailed view of for the user activity summary:

All those changes are available now as luya admin module in version 1.1.0. New headless section in guide which under developement: https://luya.io/guide/concept-headless

We also have released the luya kickstarter in version 1.0.1 with a dockerized development env which is now out of the box part of the kickstarter. Thanks to contributor [rainerCH](http://github.com/rainerCH) which did a fantastic job in bringing all those LUYA specific requests into one place. We will evolve the docker env and provide a single image on dockerhub in future.

LUYA env dev repo for extension and module developers => https://github.com/luyadev/luya-env-dev. The main purpose for this repo is an easy way for developers to create their own modules and extensions and also to maintain those. Its also a good way for contributors which would like to help improve luya core modules, it will auto clone all core modules and you can update those with a single command `./vendor/bin/luyadev repo/update`. As the repos are bound into the env dev application with PSR4 we have written a library which auto updates your composer.json so you can easy clone your own repos into the env dev like `./vendor/bin/luyadev repo/clone USERNAME/LUYA_MODULE_REPO_NAME` which will the update your composer.json and run composer dump-autoload. So if you are interested in module, extensions or contributions development take a look at this new shiny dev env => https://github.com/luyadev/luya-env-dev
