Windows and XAMPP
=================

We have tested *LUYA* on Windows with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) and using Git Shell to run commands which is installed with [Github Desktop](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) by default. After that its very easy to run all commands described in the [Installtion Instructions](install.md).
