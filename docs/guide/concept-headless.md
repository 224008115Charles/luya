#Â LUYA Headless system

As LUYA is built upon the concept of REST APIs, providing headless access to the database content of LUYA is a no brainer. You can either access the [[ngrest.md]] APIs or the CMS admin APIs. Since LUYA admin version 1.1.0 we have added the ability to create users only for API request and an overview of which endpoints they can request data from:

![API User overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luyadev/luya/master/docs/guide/img/api-user-overview.png "API User overview")

In order to make calls from your application to a luya headless admin you can use the [luya-headless client](github.com/luyadev/luya-headless).

## Make calls

In order to make calls to the LUYA Admin APIs you can either use your own library or use the [luya-headless client](github.com/luyadev/luya-headless) which provides a very easy to use wrapper which will continiuesly developed in order to match the needs of a true headless system.

Example usage with the client library:

```php
use luya\headless\Client;

// bild client object with token and server infos
$client = new Client('API_TOKEN', 'http://localhost/luya-kickstarter/public_html/admin');

// create get request for `api-admin-lang` endpoint
$request = $client->getRequest()->setEndpoint('api-admin-lang')->get();

// if successfull request, iterate over language items from `api-admin-lang` endpoint
if ($request->isSuccess()) {
    foreach ($request->getParsedResponse() as $item) {
        var_dump($item);
    }
}
```

Using API wrappers (above example as short hand wrapper):

```php
use luya\headless\Client;
use luya\headless\endpoints\ApiAdminLang;

// bild client object with token and server infos
$client = new Client('API_TOKEN', 'http://localhost/luya-kickstarter/public_html/admin');

// run the pre-built ActivQuery for the `api-admin-lang` endpoint
foreach (ApiAdminLang::find()->all($client) as $item) {
    var_dump($item);
}
```

## Options

When building a website with LUYA CMS but rendering the content with the headless client you may want to configure the preview url matching your environment.

```php
'modules' => [
    'cmsadmin' => [
        'class' => 'luya\cms\admin\Module',
        'previewUrl' => 'https://mywebsite/preview/page',
    ],
]
```
